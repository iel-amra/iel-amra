<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a student in 42 Lyon and I'm currently searching for an internship. I'm really intersted in complex algotithms and stimulating challenges.

ðŸŒ± Here is an overview of my school projects (From the newest to the oldest):
- Transcendance, the final project : It's a 5 people team project where the goal was to develop a single page website of a multiplayer game. It pocesses a user management system with 3 different athentification systems, a playable game against an other distant user or against an AI oppenent, 1 vs 1 games and tournaments, multilanguages support, and other functionalities.
- Irc : An irc protocol based chat server with basic commands.
- Inception : A docker project based where all the images needed to be built from a clean image of debian.
- Piscine CPP : A discovery of C++, from basic to complex notions such as templates, algorithms, casts and polymorphism (with different exercises such as the diamond problem)
- Cub3D : A implementation of raycasting using only the processor and a lib called Minilibx. Minilibx only allows putting pixels to an image and reading .png or an .xpm files.
- NetPractice : An introduction to Tcp-Ip protocols and routing tables.
- Minishell : A shell based on bash, with pipes, environnement handling, &&, || and () operators, redirections, basic built-ins, here-doc and wildcards
- Philosophers : A project based on threads and mutexs, where the goal is to manage a group of philosphers, each one being represented with a thread. This project emphazes on optimization
- Push_swap : The goal of the project was the creation of a sorting algorithm that needs to be optimized for a custom data structure given in the subject.
- So_long : A 2D plateformer developed with a lib called Minilibx. Minilibx only allows putting pixels to an image and reading .png or an .xpm files. The game engine needed to be implemented manually
- Pipex : Discovering pipes and forks in C, as well as execve syscall.
- Born2Beroot : An introduction to Virtual machines and OS installation and configuration.
- Get_next_line : Creating a function in C to read a line from a file with the minumum call to the read syscall
- ft_printf : A function with the same behaviour as printf, with some of its flags
- Libft : A useful librarary in C for the next projects

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a student at 42 Lyon, currently searching for an internship. I'm really interested in complex algorithms and stimulating challenges.

ðŸŒ± Here is an overview of my school projects (from the newest to the oldest):

- Transcendance (Final Project): This was a team project involving five members. Our goal was to develop a single-page website for a multiplayer game. It features a user management system with three different authentication methods, playable games against either another distant user or an AI opponent, 1 vs 1 games, tournaments, multilanguage support, and other functionalities.

- IRC: A chat server based on the IRC protocol with basic commands.

- Inception: A Docker project where all the images needed to be built from a clean Debian image.

- Piscine CPP: An exploration of C++, covering basic to complex concepts such as templates, algorithms, casts, and polymorphism (including exercises such as the diamond problem).

- Cub3D: An implementation of raycasting using only the processor and a library called Minilibx, which allows putting pixels to an image and reading .png or .xpm files.

- NetPractice: An introduction to TCP/IP protocols and routing tables.

- Minishell: A shell based on Bash, featuring pipes, environment handling, &&, ||, and () operators, redirections, basic built-ins, here-documents, and wildcards.

- Philosophers: A project based on threads and mutexes, focusing on managing a group of philosophers, each represented by a thread. This project emphasizes optimization.

- Push_swap: The goal of this project was to create a sorting algorithm optimized for a custom data structure specified in the project.

- So_long: A 2D platformer developed with a library called Minilibx. Similar to Cub3D, Minilibx allows putting pixels to an image and reading .png or .xpm files. The game engine needed to be implemented manually.

- Pipex: A project focusing on pipes and forks in C, as well as the execve syscall.

- Born2Beroot: An introduction to virtual machines and OS installation and configuration.

- Get_next_line: A function in C for reading lines from a file with minimal calls to the read syscall.

- ft_printf: A function with similar behavior to printf, including some of its flags.

- Libft: A useful C library for future projects.
